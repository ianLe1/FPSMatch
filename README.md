# FPSMatch

[![Ask DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/badge.svg)](https://deepwiki.com/SSOrangeCATY/FPSMatch)
[中文文档](README_ZH-CN.md) · [Local Wiki](WIKI.md)

FPSMatch is a Forge library mod for Minecraft 1.20.1 that provides the foundation for team-based competitive FPS gameplay. It focuses on reusable match systems, map instances, economy hooks, shops, HUD utilities, stats, and integration points for tactical weapon mods instead of shipping a complete game mode by itself. [BlockOffensive](https://github.com/PhasetransCrystal/BlockOffensive) registers the playable `cs` demolition and `csdm` deathmatch modes; standalone FPSMatch needs a comparable game-mode provider.

## Features

| Area | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Match framework | Team-based match lifecycle, map instances, room/ready flow, spectator flow, and extensible mode logic |
| Teams | Team assignment, team state, match-side data, spawn points, kits, and round-oriented gameplay support |
| Economy | Custom money systems and team shop infrastructure for weapons, gear, and throwables |
| Map tools | OP 2 map/spawn editing tools, map settings, region previews, and active-match edit guards |
| HUD and stats | HUD support plus player statistics such as KDA, headshots, and damage |
| Map rooms | Map selection, room details, join/ready management, and optional icon/detail-background textures |
| Compatibility | Requires Modern UI, Kotlin for Forge and client-side Modern UI; TaCZ and other listed gameplay mods are optional integrations |
| Commands | In-game command help is available with `/fpsm help` |

Map IDs are persistent identifiers: use 1-48 lowercase `a-z`, `0-9`, `_`, or `-` characters. Spawn points must be in the map/dimension, have solid support, two collision-free blocks, and no fluid. The [local Wiki](WIKI.md) contains the full operator/developer guide, including the [thumbnail and map-icon tutorial](WIKI.md#地图缩略图与图标填写教程).

The current workspace requires **Modern UI 1.20.1-3.12.0.1 on clients**. Map browsing, room pages, shop configuration and equipment purchases use native Modern UI controls and its text engine. Dedicated servers do not require Modern UI.

## Version Compatibility Matrix

Columns marked with `*` are required dependencies. Unmarked mod columns are compatibility integrations. The `1.3.0` row is the current source-workspace snapshot, not a confirmed public release artifact.

| FPSMatch | Distribution | Minecraft* | Forge* | Modern UI* | Kotlin for Forge* | TaCZ | TaCZ Tweaks | LR Tactical | CounterStrikeGrenade | KubeJS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.3.0 | GitHub workspace snapshot | 1.20.1 | 47.4.10 | 2.2.27+1.20.1 | 4.11.0+ | 1.1.7-hotfix | 2.11.2 | 0.4.3 | 1.20.1-1.5.2 | 2001.6.5-build.14 |
| 1.2.5 | Modrinth / CurseForge | 1.20.1 | 47.3.11 | - | - | 1.1.7-hotfix | - | 0.3.0 | 1.4.1 | - |

TaCZ is marked optional in FPSMatch metadata. CounterStrikeGrenade, LR Tactical, KubeJS, and other unmarked entries are selected by the game-mode add-on or server pack rather than declared base-framework requirements.

## How to Depend on FPSMatch

FPSMatch can be consumed from the public mod distribution Maven repositories. Pick one repository and one dependency coordinate that matches the platform you want to resolve from. The listed public coordinates are confirmed historical releases; they do not identify a public `1.3.0` snapshot artifact.

### CurseForge Maven

CurseForge Maven resolves artifacts by CurseForge project ID and file ID. The current confirmed CurseForge project ID is `1331710`, and the confirmed public file ID for `1.2.5` is `7109977`.

```gradle
repositories {
    maven {
        name = "CurseMaven"
        url = "https://www.cursemaven.com"
    }
}

dependencies {
    modImplementation "curse.maven:fpsmatch-1331710:7109977"
}
```

### Modrinth Maven

Modrinth Maven resolves artifacts by project slug and Modrinth version number. The confirmed project slug is `fpsmatch`.

```gradle
repositories {
    maven {
        name = "Modrinth"
        url = "https://api.modrinth.com/maven"
    }
}

dependencies {
    modImplementation "maven.modrinth:fpsmatch:1.2.5"
}
```

For source builds published through the project's own Maven publishing configuration, the artifact coordinate is `net.ptcrys:fpsmatch:<FPSMatch version>`.
